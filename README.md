# PrivateGroupChat
This is a fun little project I undertook to experiment with socket.io, and PostgreSQL, along with NodeJS. 

Right now, there are a couple bugs, such as the #private channel not deleting messages everyday as it should, which I'll get around to fixing later.

My end goal for this project is to enable DMs -- In other words, enable users to search for other users, and to instantiate private conversations with them.

If I have the time, I might do Group DMs.
